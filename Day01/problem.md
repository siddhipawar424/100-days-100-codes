### Day 01 – Reverse Array

**Problem:**  
Reverse the given array.

---

### Approach 1: Bruteforce
- Create a new array
- Copy elements from end to start

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

---

### Approach 2: Optimized (Two Pointers)
- Use two pointers from start and end
- Swap elements until they meet

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

**Learning:**  
Starting with a bruteforce solution helps in understanding the problem.
Optimized solutions reduce space usage and improve efficiency.
